# CAPSTONE - SOAR with LLM

## Overview
Capstone SOAR is a university project focused on integrating network security log analysis with AI to enhance threat detection, prevention, and mitigation. The system automates security analysis, detects threats in real time, and supports strategic decision-making.

## What is SOAR?
**SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)** is a technology that combines various security tools and processes to streamline operations:
- **Orchestration:** Integrates security tools (e.g., SIEM, firewalls) for seamless interaction.
- **Automation:** Reduces manual workload by handling repetitive tasks.
- **Response:** Enables rapid incident management through predefined playbooks.

## System Components
- **Simulated Network:** A controlled environment to generate and analyze realistic security event logs.
- **Wazuh:** The core platform for log collection, management, and analysis.
- **LLM (Large Language Model):** Trained on Wazuh logs and MITRE ATT&CK information to detect threats, identify patterns, and provide insights.

## Goal
Providing a system capable
of automating analyses, detecting threats in real time, and supporting
strategic decision-making for security management.

## Results
- **Training Efficiency:** Loss reduced from 0.56 to 0.09 in 45 minutes.
- **Automated Threat Detection:** Immediate risk identification and mitigation recommendations.
- **Future Improvements:** Enhanced dataset, model optimization, and user-friendly interface development.
